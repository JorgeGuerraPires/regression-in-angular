# Introduction

Data Science is all about finding information/knowledge from datasets. One very powerful approach is using linear models, called regression. Even though they are limited, they still can delivery something if the datasets have a linear tendency.

On this course, we use Angular as framework, coding environment, and TensorFlow.js as the library for creating a machine learning based regression model.
